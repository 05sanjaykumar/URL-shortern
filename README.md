# 🔗 URL Shortener

A full-stack, production-grade URL shortening service built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Redis**, and **Docker** — complete with rate limiting, RESTful API, unit tests, and deployment on Render.

---

## 🌍 Live Demo

> 🟢 Deployed on [Render](https://url-shortern-9qxj.onrender.com/)  
> Frontend: Static `HTML + JS`  
> Backend: Node.js + Redis  
> Dockerized with `Dockerfile` and `nginx` (for local use)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: Redis (for storing shortened URLs)
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom Express middleware
- **DevOps**:
  - Docker & docker-compose (for local setup)
  - Render (for cloud deployment)
  - NGINX (proxy for containerized routing)

## ✅ Features

- 🔗 Shortens long URLs to 6-character codes
- 🚀 Redirects to original URL from code
- 🧠 Stores data in **Redis**
- 🛡️ Built-in **rate limiter** middleware (basic DDoS protection)
- 🧪 Unit tested with mocks for Redis
- 🐳 Local Docker support
- 🌐 Deployed on **Render**

---

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for full stack)

```bash
docker-compose up
````

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
npm install
redis-server
npm start
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🧪 Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Includes mocks for Redis to ensure unit isolation.

---

## 🌐 Deployment (Render)

The backend and frontend are deployed using **Render.com**:

* **Backend**: Connected to Redis instance
* **Frontend**: Served via static files or nginx
* **Base URL** is set dynamically in production

## 📌 Learnings

* 📦 **Modular Express structure** with `controllers`, `routes`, and `services`
* 🧪 Wrote **unit tests** with Redis mocks
* 🐳 Learned how to containerize full-stack apps with Docker
* 🚀 Deployed using **Render** and explored cloud hosting
* 🛡️ Implemented basic **rate limiting**
* 🌱 Explored logging, monitoring, and optional CI/CD pipelines
